# ML08:2023 - Model Skewing Attack

## Overview
Model Skewing is a sophisticated attack that targets the integrity of machine learning models by manipulating training and real-world data to create inconsistencies. This leads to biased outputs or degraded model performance in production environments.

## Attack Description

### Goal
The primary objective is to compromise model performance by introducing biased or adversarial samples during training, causing the model to learn incorrect patterns that don't align with real-world scenarios.

### Impact
- Degraded model performance in production
- Incorrect decision-making
- Financial losses
- Loss of trust in AI systems
- Potential regulatory compliance issues

## How the Attack Works

### Attack Mechanism
1. **Data Poisoning**: Attacker injects carefully crafted biased or adversarial samples into training data
2. **Pattern Manipulation**: Model learns incorrect correlations that don't reflect real-world patterns
3. **Production Failure**: Model performs poorly when processing genuine data in production

### Attack Flow

## Real-World Example: Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Scenario
1. **Training Phase**:
   - Attacker injects non-fraudulent transactions with fraud-like patterns
   - Example: Large purchases deliberately marked as safe
   
2. **Impact**:
   - Model learns skewed patterns
   - Starts misclassifying genuine fraud as safe transactions
   - Legitimate customers get falsely flagged

3. **Consequences**:
   - Fraudsters bypass detection systems
   - Increased financial losses
   - Customer dissatisfaction
   - Regulatory scrutiny

## Exploit Example

### Stock Trading AI Manipulation
1. **Attack Setup**:
   - Create bot-generated data with artificial trends
   - Inject data showing failing stocks as profitable investments
   
2. **Execution**:
   - AI learns incorrect market patterns
   - Makes biased recommendations based on skewed data
   
3. **Exploitation**:
   - Attacker capitalizes on predictable incorrect predictions
   - Profits from market manipulation

## Defense Strategies

### Prevention
1. **Data Validation**
   - Implement robust data validation pipelines
   - Use anomaly detection for training data
   - Verify data sources and integrity

2. **Model Monitoring**
   - Regular performance metrics tracking
   - Drift detection
   - Anomaly detection in predictions

3. **Security Controls**
   - Access controls for training data
   - Audit trails for data modifications
   - Secure data pipeline implementation

### Detection
1. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Monitor data distribution changes
   - Track prediction patterns
   - Analyze model confidence scores

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Regular evaluation against benchmark datasets
   - Cross-validation with trusted data
   - Continuous monitoring of key metrics

## Mitigation Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Isolate affected models
2. Validate training data integrity
3. Review recent model updates
4. Document incident details

### Long-term Measures
1. Implement robust data validation
2. Enhance monitoring systems
3. Establish incident response procedures
4. Regular security assessments

## Best Practices

### Development Phase
1. Use verified training data sources
2. Implement data quality checks
3. Document data preprocessing steps
4. Maintain data provenance

### Production Phase
1. Regular model performance monitoring
2. Automated anomaly detection
3. Periodic security audits
4. Incident response planning

## Comparison with Other Attacks

### Model Skewing vs Output Integrity Attack

| Aspect | Model Skewing | Output Integrity Attack |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|
| Target | Training Data | Final Model Output |
| Method | Data Manipulation | Output Interception |
| Impact | Long-term Performance Degradation | Immediate Result Alteration |
| Duration | Persistent | Temporary |
| Detection | More Complex | Relatively Easier |

## Risk Assessment

### Severity Factors
- Long-term impact on model reliability
- Difficulty in detection
- Cost of remediation
- Business impact
- Regulatory implications

### Risk Levels
- **Impact**: High
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Detectability**: Low
- **Overall Risk**: High

## Conclusion
Model Skewing attacks represent a significant threat to AI systems, particularly due to their long-term impact and difficulty in detection. Organizations must implement comprehensive security measures and monitoring systems to protect against these attacks.
